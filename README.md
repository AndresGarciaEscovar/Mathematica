# Mathematica Codes - Instructions
These programs were written using the Mathematica 9.x or 10.x Student version. The
instructions to input the function parameters are show in each file. Sample files
are provided for programs that require the use of external files. Since the
files are pre-configured, changing the format of the files will result in the
programs not running properly. For further instructions, refer to the manuals;
if available.
